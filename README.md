# Flowers-Species-Classification
<br />
Built a two-stage domain-independent framework using Deep Learning and Evolutionary Optimization to classify flower
images into respective classes on a Kaggle dataset.<br />
Performed deep feature extraction using a pre-trained ResNet50 model implemented in PyTorch.<br />
Used Genetic Algorithm (GA) for Feature Selection and improved classification accuracy along with reducing storage
requirements.
